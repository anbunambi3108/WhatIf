# 'What If?' Stock Investment Simulator

This project allows users to simulate past stock investments and analyze how their money would have grown over time.
Users can choose a stock, set a time period, and select an investment strategy:
- Lump-Sum Investment - Invest a fixed amount on a specific date.
- Monthly Investment (Dollar-Cost Averaging) - Invest a fixed amount every month over time.
- Buy-the-Dip Strategy - Invest only when stock prices drop below a certain level.
  
The program retrieves historical stock data, calculates potential returns, and visualizes investment performance.
It's a financial "time machine" that helps users understand investment growth without actual risk.
